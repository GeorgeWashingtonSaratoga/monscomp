      content: "No sooner after my expedition into the earthen island began than I quickly discovered a group of remarkably odd stone-bodied creatures. Once, I had deemed such creatures impossible, but this world has broadened my perspective on the possibilities of life. It’s as if the very land I stand upon now could come alive at any moment! \n \t These stone-bodied creatures, of which Spurrit referred to in his notes as \“Noggins\”, resemble mere boulders upon first glance, albeit with unnaturally flat tops. Noggins possess notably large hands on either side of their heads and feet of a pale tan hue, reminiscent of some lichens. \n \t Noggins appear to communicate with one another through rhythmic tapping of their heads. I have noticed that every pile of Noggins have a unique tone they communicate through, yet every pile on any given landmass maintains a uniform rhythm, beat for beat. Perhaps they share a common ancestry with one another? \n \t Examination of the skeletal structure of a deceased Noggin reveals a curious anatomy, most notably the combination of a rocky exoskeleton along with a more standard endoskeleton. Back home, I’d believe this creature to have common ancestry with tortoises. The cranium and mandible of the Noggin compose the entirety of the exoskeleton, as well as a majority of the entire skeletal system. \n \t Further examination of the cranium reveals three distinct cavities: \n \t i) The smallest cavity is positioned directly behind the orbits, featuring multiple openings leading towards the body, likely housing the nervous system. \n \t ii) The second largest cavity is positioned directly below the top of the head. Its function is unknown, though I hypothesise it amplifies the many strikes against its head, allowing for the sound to carry further. \n \t iii) The largest cavity is positioned directly behind the mandible bone of the Noggin, likely containing the majority of its vital organs."
